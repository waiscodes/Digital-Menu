# Capstone Project: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe

## Problem

I’m always flustered and end up ordering the most familiar thing on the menu because I often don’t recognize names of menu items. I always find it easier to choose when the menu items have pictures, and I’m always more willing to get out of my comfort zone to choose different types of foods when they do.

## Solution

A web app menu that includes pictures of menu items as well as details of the menu items when clicked on.

### Users

    * Customer (Guest)
    * Administrator (Account)
